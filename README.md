Social Network Analysis

The program is based on NetworkX, which is a python library for network analysis.
Environment: Python 2.7.5 on linux (Ubuntu 12.04)

Notes:

1. graph.py is the source code, which is written in Linux using vim. If you want to open it in Windows, you'd better use WordPad rather than Notepad.

2. No compliation is needed as python is an interpreted language. Just run it with command "python graph.py". Then the program will show the usage.

3. To create a network graph from files, type "create". Then input the files name: "sigcomm_author.txt" for nodes list, and "sigcomm_network.txt" for edges list. After creating the graph, you can analyze the graph using other commands.

4. For some properties of the graph, the output is large. I will save the output into files. So make sure the program has the permission to write disk.


Enjoy~ :-)
